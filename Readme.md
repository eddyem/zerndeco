Wavefront decomposition by Zernike polynomials
==============================================


Coordinate system - Cartesian (X from left to right, Y from bottom to top)
On images coordinate system the same, so first byte of image is its left bottom corner!

make:
DEF=DWF_EPSILON=eps -  set minimal value of vawefront that would mean zero to `eps` (default: 1e-12)
